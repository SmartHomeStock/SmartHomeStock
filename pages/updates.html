				<h2>Initial Meetings</h2>
				<p class="styled-paragraph">
				We initiated the brainstorming phase to generate project ideas and concluded that we wanted to create something focused on improving logistical efficiency – a practical, compact, and user-friendly solution for the general public. After a thorough discussion of ideas, we arrived at the final proposal for a product aimed at optimizing household shopping, particularly concerning groceries. Subsequent steps involved seeking out a mentor to guide us through the process, establishing a timeline with goals to achieve throughout the year, and identifying the fundamental skills required for project development. For instance, we recognized the need to learn HTML for website creation. In this context, we acquired the necessary skills to meet our objectives, implemented a structured timeline for ongoing guidance, and remained committed to the continuous development of the project.

				We began envisioning the containers, raising questions about practicality, loading, and design. 
				One idea that emerged was to have an outer container with an inner container for storing the food. 
				The outer container would feature a scale at its base, and it would be taller than the inner one to allow stacking without affecting the weight measured by the lower container's scale.We also contemplated the possibility of inductive charging, although our knowledge on the subject was limited. 
				For the scale, we envisioned a functionality where it starts off when the container is removed, remains active for 5 seconds upon being placed back, and then turns off again. Regarding materials, we considered using acrylic-polystyrene plastic for both the container and the lid, and synthetic rubber for the seal.

				<h2>11/12/2023</h2>
				<p class="styled-paragraph"> 
				We began planning the components for the scale. After watching several videos and exploring various websites, we considered using the following components: HX711 + Load Cell, Arduino, ESP-8266 (Wi-Fi), or HC-06 (Bluetooth).
				At this stage, we concluded the HTML study and commenced the website development. Concurrently, we designed the first prototype.

				<p class="styled-paragraph"> 
				The group was divided into two distinct teams. The first team, composed of Renato, Ricardo, and Rafaela, focused primarily on developing the prototype for publication, as well as selecting materials and hardware. 
				Conversely, the second team, consisting of Vera, Leonor, and Henrique, was dedicated to website development. 
				Both teams aimed to achieve their respective objectives by January 8, 2024. 
				During the planning phase, there was a reassessment of the material choice for the container's base. 
				The idea emerged to link this base to a "mini router," equipped with either an ESP 8266 or ESP 32. 
				The container itself would be outfitted with a BLE or ESP 8266 to establish a connection with the router.

					During the first in-person meeting with coordinator Teresa Vazão, we explained our project idea in greater detail and showcased our progress. We discussed the main differences between our product and other existing scales. We also talked about how our product differs from Smart Fridges made by major companies such as Samsung and LG.
					We discussed the origin of the idea, and the teacher suggested conducting surveys with people to see if our idea addresses real problems.
					We reviewed our material list, and the teacher asked us to estimate the price of the product.
					We concluded that for the mid-term presentation, we would like to present a prototype with functioning hardware and a first version of the application.

					We created a form aimed at understanding our product's target audience and assessing its alignment with their needs. Additionally, we solicited suggestions to enhance the project.
					The website was completed, featuring a footer with the SHS logo and links to app stores (although the application is not yet available, the links were included). GitHub repository links were also included in the footer. We added the form link to the website.
					Further research was conducted on the hardware for our initial prototype, focusing on the ESP32. We opted for the ESP32 Wroom NodeMcu Wifi CP102 module for use in the weight container, while considering other ESP options for different container types.
					Moreover, we determined the need for a higher voltage and decided to add an extra AA battery to increase it. As the resulting voltage was excessively high, we also included a step-down Uin converter in the container to regulate the voltage as needed.
					We outlined the following plan:

					This week, we crafted a cardboard prototype for the section where the container hardware will be inserted.

					This exercise served to provide us with a visual perspective of our product, and to showcase it to the coordinator. 
					It will also be useful for presenting to our target audience. Issues such as price versus convenience were raised. 
					On one hand, we fear that our product may be too expensive for consumers (as they would need to purchase multiple containers for home use), but on the other hand, finding a solution that allows the use of a single scale for multiple containers reduces the automation and independence of the product. 
					We also began sketching out the application on paper:

					We have been exploring information about ESP32s as we are considering the possibility of developing our own microcontroller in the future. 
					This could potentially make our product more cost-effective.
